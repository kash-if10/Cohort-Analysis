# Cohort-Analysis
An online retail company is struggling to analyze customer behavior and optimize its marketing strategies to enhance retention and overall business performance. A major challenge is the lack of insights into customer retention trends over time.

One key concern is the declining retention rate, as a large number of customers make only a single purchase and do not return. Identifying the factors behind this trend and developing strategies to boost customer retention is essential for long-term growth.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis reveals notable fluctuations in both customer retention and store sales over the years 2010 and 2011. While the retention rate initially decreased in 2010, it showed signs of improvement in 2011. However, our findings also highlight a significant decline in store sales during December 2011 compared to the previous year. These observations underscore the importance of further investigation into the underlying factors influencing these trends. With additional data and analysis, we can gain deeper insights into the reasons behind these fluctuations and formulate strategies to enhance customer retention and stabilize sales performance, particularly during seasonal peaks and troughs. By addressing these issues, we can position our business for sustainable growth and success in the future.
